# glowy3d

This is a framework for creating 3d applications made for educational purposes (working environment for computer graphics course in Southern Federal University).  

It has c++14 binding for common opengl conceptions and considered to be easy to use.

It is a fork of [glowy2d](https://github.com/Rasie1/glowy2d/) engine previously made by me in 2014.
